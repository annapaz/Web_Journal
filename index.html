                <p>What exactly is big data?

                    Big data refers to massive, complex data sets that are rapidly generated and transmitted from a wide <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> variety of sources. Big data sets can be structured, semi-structured and unstructured, and they are frequently analyzed to discover applicable patterns and insights about user and machine activity. 

                        How Is Big Data Used?
                        
                        The diversity of big data makes it inherently complex, resulting in the need for systems capable of processing its various structural and semantic differences.

                        Cloud-based quantum computing is a new and innovative way for businesses to take advantage of quantum computing’s massive processing power. Quantum computers are able to process massive amounts of data very quickly, making them perfect for complex mathematical calculations and data analysis. Cloud-based quantum computing allows businesses to access quantum computing power without having to purchase and maintain their own quantum computer. This type of software also makes it possible for businesses to collaborate with other businesses and researchers to solve complex problems that would be impossible to solve with traditional computers.</span></p>

                <p>What is computer vision?
                    Computer Vision is a field of artificial intelligence that <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> ttrains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects — and then react to what they “see.”

                        Cyber Security is the practice of protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks. Also known as information technology (IT) security, cybersecurity measures are designed to combat threats against networked systems and applications, whether those threats originate from inside or outside of an organization.
                        
                        Additive manufacturing (also called 3-dimensional printing) is a set of technologies that assemble objects from smaller pieces of material. Some examples of these technologies include fused filament fabrication (may involve extruding thermoplastic filament), vat polymerization (using an ultraviolet light to cure a polymer), or powder bed fusion (melting together metal, ceramic, or plastic powder with high-power lasers or other heat sources). Once just used for prototyping, these techniques are becoming less expensive and are seeing use in production as well, affecting the automotive, aerospace, electronics, medical, and consumer markets.</span></p>
